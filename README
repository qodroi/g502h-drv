G502-Hero Kernel Driver
============================

This driver aims to allow G502-Hero to have the same functionally as it has on Windows, this includes DPI and Report Rate changes, LED controliing, up to 5 configurations and more. There are some bugs and developement is quite slow but I will be working on this repo for the next few months.
